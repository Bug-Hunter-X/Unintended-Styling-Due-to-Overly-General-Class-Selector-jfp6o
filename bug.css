The following CSS code snippet uses a class selector that is too general, leading to unintended styling across multiple elements:

```css
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}
```

This will apply the button styles to any element with the class "button", even if it's not intended to be a button.  If another element uses this class, it will unexpectedly inherit the button styles.
